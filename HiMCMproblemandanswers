2. What’s the relationship between temperature and CO2? Many scientists think that there is a
relationship between warming global temperatures and the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.
Use your work in part 1 and Temps Data Set 2 to assist in your comparison of land-ocean
temperatures and CO2 concentration levels.

a. Build a model to predict future land-ocean temperatures changes. When does your model
predict the average land-ocean temperature will change by 1.25°C, 1.50°C, and 2°C
compared to the base period of 1951-1980?
model: 

b. Build a model to analyze the relationship (if any) between CO2 concentrations and landocean temperatures since 1959. Explain the relationship or justify that there is no
relationship.


c. Extend your model from part 2.b. into the future. How far into the future is your model
reliable? What concerns, if any, do you have with your model’s ability to predict future CO2
concentration levels and/or land-ocean temperatures?
